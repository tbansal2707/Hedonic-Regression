# Hedonic-Regression

My project statement involves :
1. The effect of different parameters like star rating, availability of free Wi-Fi, free breakfast, swimming pool, distance from airport, hotel capacity, city name on the price of the hotels
2. Study the change in prices when it is New Years and not New Years and how do the prices vary (since both dates are weekend dates, I didn’t consider weekend separately)
3. Also, an analysis of price variation with four scenarios (is it a tourist city? Is it a metropolitan city? Is it both? Is it none?) For that I have considered the four cities with different parameters for these.
4. I also study factors that might violate the linear regression assumptions including Multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, outliers analysis.
Note : I am assuming that all other charges are implicit in this i.e., if a hotel providesa service that others don’t like bigger room sizes, rooms with a view etc., they have not been considered.
